Bugfixes and quality of life changes for Noita.

Lots of things that were fixed by this mod are now patched so I removed them from the mod and the list below. I left the old list of fixes inside the mod for anyone curious.

-Perk list fix. Makes Oil Blood, Gas Blood, Electricity and Explosive Corpses remove the related immunities from the pool like they were supposed to.

-Sunstone fix. Sunseed and sunstone items can no longer be deleted during NG+ entry.

-Copy Three Random Spells fix. This spell didn't always create 3 copies like promised, because of draw in the middle of the cast. It now gets 3 random spells first and then calls them.

-Ruby fix. A cosmetic reward wasn't being awarded reliably, it should work better now.

-Crystal key fix. Fixed an issue where losing a crystal key that had listened to a music machine would lock you out of the quest.

-Fungal shifting quality of life. Dark cave next to mines now spawns some green fungus so you can always do shifting.

-Explosive detonator fix. Explosive detonator had an error causing it to sometimes fail.

-Perk loading fix. Due to the perk altar spawning inbetween two chunks, players could sometimes lose one or more perks due to restarting/crashing. No longer happens.

-HM statue quality of life. Statues can no longer die, letting you test damage on them as much as you like.

-Sun Crystal fix. The crystals that spawn on the scale easily lose the entity tied to them. The floating island now also spawns material checkers in case the entity is gone.

-Ice ball performance fix. (Thanks Conga Lyne!)

-Ending fix. Fixed a softlock from using Sampo in the wrong spot while having 33 or more orbs.

-Moon radar QoL. Moon radar can now track all kinds of celestial bodies.

-Spatial Awareness QoL. Spatial Awareness can now count beyond 3. (Thanks Priskip!)

-Gold drop performance fix. In very long runs, enemies could spawn enough gold to cause significant performance hit. Single enemy is limited to 400k now. (Thanks Conga Lyne!)

-Iron Stomach QoL. When ingesting poly liquids or poisons, player would get briefly immune to those status effects. The duration is now visible on the UI.(Poison part disabled for now due to issue)
